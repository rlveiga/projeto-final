Dogecoin (/ˈdoʊ(d)ʒkɔɪn/ DOHJ-koyn or DOHZH-koyn,[2] code: DOGE, symbol: Ð) is a cryptocurrency created by software engineers Billy Markus and Jackson Palmer, who decided to create a payment system as a "joke", making fun of the wild speculation in cryptocurrencies at the time.[3] Despite its satirical nature, some consider it a legitimate investment prospect. Dogecoin features the face of the Shiba Inu dog from the "Doge" meme as its logo and namesake.[4][5][6] It was introduced on December 6, 2013, and quickly developed its own online community, reaching a market capitalization of over $85 billion[b] on May 5, 2021.[7] It is the current shirt sponsor (sleeve only) of Premier League club Watford.[8]

Dogecoin.com promotes the currency as the "fun and friendly Internet currency", referencing its origins as a "joke."[9]

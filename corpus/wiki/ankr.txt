Ankr (ANKR) is an Ethereum token that powers Ankr, a Web3 infrastructure and cross-chain staking DeFi platform that aims to increase efficiency in blockchain ecosystems by building dApps, hosting nodes or staking.[1][2] The ANKR token can be used to pay for services on the Ankr platform, such as node deployment and API services, participate in on-chain governance and also acts as an insurance for network participants. Ankr uses idle computing resources in data centers to help developers and enterprise clients to quickly deploy blockchain nodes at a lower cost than public cloud providers.[3][4] Coinbase began supporting ANKR for trades on March 23, 2021.[5]

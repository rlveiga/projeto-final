An initial coin offering (ICO) or initial currency offering is a type of funding using cryptocurrencies. It is often a form of crowdfunding, although a private ICO which does not seek public investment is also possible. In an ICO, a quantity of cryptocurrency is sold in the form of "tokens" ("coins") to speculators or investors, in exchange for legal tender or other (generally established and more stable) cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin or Ether. The tokens are promoted as future functional units of currency if or when the ICO's funding goal is met and the project successfully launches.

An ICO can be a source of capital for startup companies. ICOs can allow startups to avoid regulations that prevent them from seeking investment directly from the public, and intermediaries such as venture capitalists, banks, and stock exchanges, which may demand greater scrutiny and some percentage of future profits or joint ownership.[1] ICOs may fall outside existing regulations,[2][3] depending on the nature of the project, or be banned altogether in some jurisdictions, such as China and South Korea.

Due to the lack of regulation and enforcement of securities law, ICOs have been the vehicle for scams and fraud.[4][5][6][7] Fewer than half of all ICOs survive four months after the offering,[8] while almost half of ICOs sold in 2017 failed by February 2018.[9] Despite their record of failure and the falling prices of cryptocurrencies, a record $7 billion was raised via ICO from Januaryâ€“June 2018.[10]

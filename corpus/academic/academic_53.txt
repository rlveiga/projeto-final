Decentralized finance (DeFi) has become one of the most
successful applications of blockchain and smart contracts. The DeFi
ecosystem enables a wide range of crypto-financial activities, while the
underlying smart contracts often contain bugs, with many vulnerabilities
arising from the unforeseen consequences of composing DeFi protocols
together. In this paper, we propose a formal process-algebraic technique
that models DeFi protocols in a compositional manner to allow for efficient
property verification. We also conduct a case study to demonstrate the
proposed approach in analyzing the composition of two interacting DeFi
protocols, namely, Curve and Compound. Finally, we discuss how the
proposed modeling and verification approach can be used to analyze
financial and security properties of interest.

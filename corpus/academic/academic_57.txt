Blockchain is a form of distributed ledger technology (DLT) where data is shared among users connected over the
internet. Transactions are data state changes on the blockchain
that are permanently recorded in a secure and transparent way
without the need of a third party. Besides, the introduction of
smart contracts to the blockchain has added programmability
to the blockchain and revolutionized the software ecosystem
leading toward decentralized applications (DApps) attracting
businesses and organizations to employ this technology. Although
promising, blockchains and smart contracts have no access to the
external systems (i.e., off-chain) where real-world data and events
resides; consequently, the usability of smart contracts in terms
of performance and programmability would be limited to the onchain data. Hence, blockchain oracles are introduced to mitigate
the issue and are defined as trusted third-party services that send
and verify the external information (i.e., feedback) and submit it
to smart contracts for triggering state changes in the blockchain.
In this paper, we will study and analyze blockchain oracles with
regard to how they provide feedback to the blockchain and smart
contracts. We classify the blockchain oracle techniques into two
major groups such as voting-based strategies and reputationbased ones. The former mainly relies on participantsâ€™ stakes
for outcome finalization while the latter considers reputation in
conjunction with authenticity proof mechanisms for data correctness and integrity. We then provide a structured description
of patterns in detail for each classification and discuss research
directions in the end.

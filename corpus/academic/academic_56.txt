Cryptocurrencies and Blockchain-based technologies are disrupting all markets. While the potential of such technologies remains to be seen, there is a current
need to understand emergent patterns of user behavior and token adoption in order to design future products. In this paper we analyze the social dynamics taking
place during one arbitrary day on the ERC20 platform. We characterize the network of token transactions among agents. We show heterogeneous profiles of user
behavior, portfolio diversity, and token adoption. While most users are specialized
in transacting with a few tokens, those that have diverse portfolios are bridging
across large parts of the network and may jeopardize the system stability. We
believe this work to be a foundation for unveiling the usage dynamics of cryptocurrencies networks.

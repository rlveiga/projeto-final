Decentralized finance, i.e., DeFi, has become the
most popular type of application on many public blockchains
(e.g., Ethereum) in recent years. Compared to the traditional
finance, DeFi allows customers to flexibly participate in diverse
blockchain financial services (e.g., lending, borrowing, collateralizing, exchanging etc.) via smart contracts at a relatively low cost
of trust. However, the open nature of DeFi inevitably introduces
a large attack surface, which is a severe threat to the security
of participantsâ€™ funds. In this paper, we proposed BLOCKEYE,
a real-time attack detection system for DeFi projects on the
Ethereum blockchain. Key capabilities provided by BLOCKEYE
are twofold: (1) Potentially vulnerable DeFi projects are identified
based on an automatic security analysis process, which performs
symbolic reasoning on the data flow of important service states,
e.g., asset price, and checks whether they can be externally
manipulated. (2) Then, a transaction monitor is installed offchain for a vulnerable DeFi project. Transactions sent not only
to that project but other associated projects as well are collected
for further security analysis. A potential attack is flagged if
a violation is detected on a critical invariant configured in
BLOCKEYE, e.g., Benefit is achieved within a very short time and
way much bigger than the cost. We applied BLOCKEYE in several
popular DeFi projects and managed to discover potential security
attacks that are unreported before.

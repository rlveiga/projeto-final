The prosperity of the cryptocurrency ecosystem drives the needs for digital asset trading platforms. Beyond
centralized exchanges (CEXs), decentralized exchanges (DEXs) are introduced to allow users to trade cryptocurrency without transferring the custody of their digital assets to the middlemen, thus eliminating the
security and privacy issues of CEX. Uniswap, as the most prominent cryptocurrency DEX, is continuing to
attract scammers, with fraudulent cryptocurrencies flooding in the ecosystem. In this paper, we take the first
step to detect and characterize scam tokens on Uniswap. We first collect all the transactions related to Uniswap
exchanges and investigate the landscape of cryptocurrency trading on Uniswap from different perspectives.
Then, we propose an accurate approach for flagging scam tokens on Uniswap based on a guilt-by-association
heuristic and a machine-learning powered technique. We have identified over 10K scam tokens listed on
Uniswap, which suggests that roughly 50% of the tokens listed on Uniswap are scam tokens. All the scam tokens
and liquidity pools are created specialized for the “rug pull” scams, and some scam tokens have embedded
tricks and backdoors in the smart contracts. We further observe that thousands of collusion addresses help
carry out the scams in league with the scam token/pool creators. The scammers have gained a profit of at
least $16 million from 40,165 potential victims. Our observations in this paper suggest the urgency to identify
and stop scams in the decentralized finance ecosystem.

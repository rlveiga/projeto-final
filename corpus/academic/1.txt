Bitcoin is the first and most popular decentralized cryptocurrency to date. In this work, we
extract and analyze the core of the Bitcoin protocol, which we term the Bitcoin backbone, and
prove two of its fundamental properties which we call common prefix and chain quality in the
static setting where the number of players remains fixed. Our proofs hinge on appropriate and
novel assumptions on the “hashing power” of the adversary relative to network synchronicity;
we show our results to be tight under high synchronization.
Next, we propose and analyze applications that can be built “on top” of the backbone
protocol, specifically focusing on Byzantine agreement (BA) and on the notion of a public
transaction ledger. Regarding BA, we observe that Nakamoto’s suggestion falls short of solving
it, and present a simple alternative which works assuming that the adversary’s hashing power
is bounded by 1/3. The public transaction ledger captures the essence of Bitcoin’s operation
as a cryptocurrency, in the sense that it guarantees the liveness and persistence of committed
transactions. Based on this notion we describe and analyze the Bitcoin system as well as a
more elaborate BA protocol, proving them secure assuming high network synchronicity and
that the adversary’s hashing power is strictly less than 1/2, while the adversarial bound needed
for security decreases as the network desynchronizes.
Finally, we extend our analysis of the Bitcoin backbone protocol for synchronous networks
with relative ease to the partially synchronous model, where the upper bound in the delay of
messages is unknown to the honest parties, showing its security for a suitable range of parameter
values.

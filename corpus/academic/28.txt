Existing data storage systems offer a wide range of functionalities
to accommodate an equally diverse range of applications. However, new classes of applications have emerged, e.g., blockchain
and collaborative analytics, featuring data versioning, fork semantics, tamper-evidence or any combination thereof. They present
new opportunities for storage systems to efficiently support such
applications by embedding the above requirements into the storage.
In this paper, we present ForkBase, a storage engine designed for
blockchain and forkable applications. By integrating core application properties into the storage, ForkBase not only delivers high
performance but also reduces development effort. The storage manages multiversion data and supports two variants of fork semantics
which enable different fork worklflows. ForkBase is fast and space
efficient, due to a novel index class that supports efficient queries as
well as effective detection of duplicate content across data objects,
branches and versions. We demonstrate ForkBaseâ€™s performance
using three applications: a blockchain platform, a wiki engine and
a collaborative analytics application. We conduct extensive experimental evaluation against respective state-of-the-art solutions. The
results show that ForkBase achieves superior performance while
significantly lowering the development effort.

The growing adoption of smart contracts on blockchains poses new security risks that can lead to
significant monetary loss, while existing approaches either provide no (or partial) security guarantees
for smart contracts or require huge proof effort. To address this challenge, we present SciviK, a
versatile framework for specifying and verifying industrial-grade smart contracts. SciviKâ€™s versatile
approach extends previous efforts with three key contributions: (i) an expressive annotation system
enabling built-in directives for vulnerability pattern checking, neural-based loop invariant inference,
and the verification of rich properties of real-world smart contracts (ii) a fine-grained model for
the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) that provides low-level execution semantics, (iii) an IR-level
verification framework integrating both SMT solvers and the Coq proof assistant.
We use SciviK to specify and verify security properties for 12 benchmark contracts and a realworld Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contract. Among all 158 specified security properties
(in six types), 151 properties can be automatically verified within 2 seconds, five properties can be
automatically verified after moderate modifications, and two properties are manually proved with
around 200 lines of Coq code.

The continuing expansion of the blockchain ecosystems has
attracted much attention from the research community. However, although a large number of research studies have been
proposed to understand the diverse characteristics of individual blockchain systems (e.g., Bitcoin or Ethereum), little is known at a comprehensive level on the evolution of
blockchain ecosystems at scale, longitudinally, and across
multiple blockchains. We argue that understanding the dynamics of blockchain ecosystems could provide unique insights that cannot be achieved through studying a single
static snapshot or a single blockchain network alone. Based
on billions of transaction records collected from three representative and popular blockchain systems (Bitcoin, Ethereum
and EOSIO) over 10 years, we conduct the first study on the
evolution of multiple blockchain ecosystems from different
perspectives. Our exploration suggests that, although the
overall blockchain ecosystem shows promising growth over
the last decade, a number of worrying “outliers” exist that
have disrupted its evolution.

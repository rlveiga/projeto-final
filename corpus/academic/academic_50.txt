We document an ongoing research process towards the implementation and integration of a digital artefact, executing the lifecycle of a leveraged trade with permissionless blockchain technology. By employing core functions of the ‘Dai Stablecoin system’ deployed on the Ethereum blockchain, we produce
the equivalent exposure of a leveraged position while deterministically automating the monitoring and
liquidation processes. We demonstrate the implementation and early integration of the artefact into a
hardened exchange environment through a microservice utilizing standardized API calls. The early results presented in this paper were produced in collaboration with a team of stakeholders at a hosting
organization, a multi-national online brokerage and cryptocurrency exchange. We utilize the design science research methodology (DSR) guiding the design, development, and evaluation of the artefact. Our
findings indicate that, while it is feasible to implement the lifecycle of a leveraged trade on the blockchain, the integration of the artefact into a traditional exchange environment involves multiple compromises and drawback. Generalizing the tentative findings presented in this paper, we introduce three
propositions on the implementation, integration, and implications of executing key business processes
with permissionless blockchain technologies. By conducting computational design science research, we
contribute to the information systems discourse on the applied utility of permissionless blockchain technologies in finance and beyond.

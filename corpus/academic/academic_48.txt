Yield farming has been an immensely popular activity for
cryptocurrency holders since the explosion of Decentralized Finance (DeFi)
in the summer of 2020. In this Systematization of Knowledge (SoK), we
study a general framework for yield farming strategies with empirical
analysis. First, we summarize the fundamentals of yield farming by focusing on the protocols and tokens used by aggregators. We then examine the sources of yield and translate those into three example yield
farming strategies, followed by the simulations of yield farming performance, based on these strategies. We further compare four major yield
aggregrators—Idle, Pickle, Harvest and Yearn—in the ecosystem, along
with brief introductions of others. We systematize their strategies and
revenue models, and conduct an empirical analysis with on-chain data
from example vaults, to find a plausible connection between data anomalies and historical events. Finally, we discuss the benefits and risks of yield
aggregators.

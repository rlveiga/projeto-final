The blockchain paradigm when coupled with cryptographically-secured transactions has demonstrated its
utility through a number of projects, not least Bitcoin. Each such project can be seen as a simple application on
a decentralised, but singleton, compute resource. We can call this paradigm a transactional singleton machine with
shared-state.
Ethereum implements this paradigm in a generalised manner. Furthermore it provides a plurality of such resources,
each with a distinct state and operating code but able to interact through a message-passing framework with others.
We discuss its design, implementation issues, the opportunities it provides and the future hurdles we envisage.

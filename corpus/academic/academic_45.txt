Decentralized Finance (DeFi) took shape in 2020. An
unprecedented amount of over 14 billion USD moved into DeFi
projects offering trading, loans and insurance. But its growth
has also drawn the attention of malicious actors. Many projects
were exploited as quickly as they launched and millions of USD
were lost. While many developers understand integer overflows
and reentrancy attacks, security threats to the DeFi ecosystem
are more complex and still poorly understood. In this paper we
provide the first overview of in-the-wild DeFi security incidents.
We observe that many of these exploits are market attacks,
weaponizing weakly implemented business logic in one protocol
with credit provided by another to inflate appropriations. Rather
than misusing individual protocols, attackers increasingly use
DeFiâ€™s strength of permissionless composability against itself.
By providing the first holistic analysis of real-world security
incidents within the nascent financial ecosystem DeFi is, we
hope to inform threat modeling in decentralized cryptoeconomic
initiatives in the years ahead.

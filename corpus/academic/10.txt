CONIKS is a proposed key transparency system which enables a centralized service provider to maintain an auditable yet privacypreserving directory of users’ public keys. In the original CONIKS design,
users must monitor that their data is correctly included in every published snapshot of the directory, necessitating either slow updates or trust
in an unspecified third-party to audit that the data structure has stayed
consistent. We demonstrate that the data structures for CONIKS are
very similar to those used in Ethereum, a consensus computation platform with a Turing-complete programming environment. We can take
advantage of this to embed the core CONIKS data structures into an
Ethereum contract with only minor modifications. Users may then trust
the Ethereum network to audit the data structure for consistency and
non-equivocation. Users who do not trust (or are unaware of) Ethereum
can self-audit the CONIKS data structure as before. We have implemented a prototype contract for our hybrid EthIKS scheme, demonstrating that it adds only modest bandwidth overhead to CONIKS proofs and
costs hundredths of pennies per key update in fees at today’s rates.

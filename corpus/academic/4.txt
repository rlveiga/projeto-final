Most prominent cryptocurrencies utilize proof of work (PoW)
to secure their operation, yet PoW suffers from two key undesirable properties. First, the work done is generally wasted, not useful for anything
but the gleaned security of the cryptocurrency. Second, PoW is naturally outsourceable, leading to inegalitarian concentration of power in
the hands of few so-called pools that command large portions of the
systemâ€™s computation power.
We introduce a general approach to constructing PoW called PieceWork
that tackles both issues. In essence, PieceWork allows for a configurable
fraction of PoW computation to be outsourced to workers. Its controlled
outsourcing allows for reusing the work towards additional goals such
as spam prevention and DoS mitigation, thereby reducing PoW waste.
Meanwhile, PieceWork can be tuned to prevent excessive outsourcing.
Doing so causes pool operation to be significantly more costly than today.
This disincentivizes aggregation of work in mining pools.

The recently proposed Uniswap v3 replaces the fungible liquidity
provider token (LP token) into non-fungible ones, making the design for liquidity mining more difficult. In this paper, we propose a
flexible liquidity mining scheme that realizes the overall liquidity
distribution through the fine control of local rewards. From the
liquidity providerâ€™s point of view, the liquidity provision strategy
forms a multiplayer zero-sum game. We analyze the Nash Equilibrium and the corresponding strategy, approximately, deploying
the liquidity proportional to the reward distribution, in some special cases and use it to guide the general situations. Based on the
strategic response above, such a scheme allows the mining rewards
provider to optimize the distribution of liquidity for the purpose
such as low slippage and price stabilization.

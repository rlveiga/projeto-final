We show how the Bitcoin currency system (with a small modification)
can be used to obtain fairness in any two-party secure computation protocol in the
following sense: if one party aborts the protocol after learning the output then the
other party gets a financial compensation (in bitcoins). One possible application
of such protocols is the fair contract signing: each party is forced to complete the
protocol, or to pay to the other one a fine.
We also show how to link the output of this protocol to the Bitcoin currency. More
precisely: we show a method to design secure two-party protocols for functionalities that result in a “forced” financial transfer from one party to the other.
Our protocols build upon the ideas of our recent paper “Secure Multiparty Computations on Bitcoin” (Cryptology ePrint Archive, Report 2013/784). Compared
to that paper, our results are more general, since our protocols allow to compute
any function, while in the previous paper we concentrated only on some specific
tasks (commitment schemes and lotteries). On the other hand, as opposed to “Secure Multiparty Computations on Bitcoin”, to obtain security we need to modify
the Bitcoin specification so that the transactions are “non-malleable” (we discuss
this concept in more detail in the paper).

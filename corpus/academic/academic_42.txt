We provide an overview of decentralized protocols like Compound and Aave
that offer collateralized loans for cryptoasset investors. Compound and Aave are
two of the most important application in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystem. Using publicly available information on rates, supply and borrow activity,
and accounts we analyze different elements of the protocols. In particular, we
estimate ex-post margins that give a comprehensive account of the cost of financial intermediation. We find that ex-post margins considering all markets are 1%
and lower for stablecoin markets. In addition, we estimate quarterly indicators
regarding solvency, asset quality, earnings and market risk similar to the ones
used in traditional banking. This provides a first look at the use of these metrics
and a comparison between the similarities and challenges to our understanding
of financial intermediation in these protocols based on tools used for traditional
banking.

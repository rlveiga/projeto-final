In this review, we evaluate the mechanisms
behind the decentralized finance protocols
for generating stable, passive income. Currently, some savings interest rates can be
as high as 20% annually, payable in traditional currency values such as US dollars.
Therefore, one can benefit from the growth
of the cryptocurrency markets, with minimal exposure to their volatility risks. We
aim to explain the rationale behind these
savings products in simple terms. The key
here is that asset deposits in cryptocurrency
ecosystems are of intrinsic economic value,
as they facilitate network consensus mechanisms and automated marketplaces. Therefore, savings in cryptocurrency are associated with some unique advantages unavailable in traditional financial systems. We
will go through the implementations of how
savings can be channeled into the staking
deposits in Proof-of-Stake (PoS) protocols,
through fixed-rate lending protocols, and
staking derivative tokens. We will discuss
potential pitfalls, assess how these protocols
may behave in market cycles, as well as suggest areas for further research and development. We end by discussing the notion of
decentralized basic income â€“ analogous to
universal basic income but guaranteed by financial products on blockchains instead of
public policies.

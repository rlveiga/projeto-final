BitShares 2.0 is an industrial-grade decentralized
platform built for high-performance financial smart contracts. The decentralized exchange that allows for trading
of arbitrary pairs without counterparty risk facilitates only
one out of many available features. Market-pegged assets,
such as the bitUSD, are crypto tokens that come with all
the advantages of traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin
but trade for at least the value of their underlying asset, e.g.
$1. Furthermore, BitShares represents the first decentralized
autonomous company that lets its shareholders decide on
its future direction and products. This paper gives a brief
overview over the whole BitShares platform, recapitulates
known blockchain technologies and redefines state-of-the-art.

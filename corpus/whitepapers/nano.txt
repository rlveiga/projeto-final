Recently, high demand and limited scalability have
increased the average transaction times and fees in popular
cryptocurrencies, yielding an unsatisfactory experience. Here we
introduce Nano, a cryptocurrency with a novel block-lattice architecture where each account has its own blockchain, delivering
near instantaneous transaction speed and unlimited scalability.
Each user has their own blockchain, allowing them to update
it asynchronously to the rest of the network, resulting in fast
transactions with minimal overhead. Transactions keep track
of account balances rather than transaction amounts, allowing
aggressive database pruning without compromising security. To
date, the Nano network has processed 4.2 million transactions
with an unpruned ledger size of only 1.7GB. Nanoâ€™s feeless,
split-second transactions make it the premier cryptocurrency for
consumer transactions.

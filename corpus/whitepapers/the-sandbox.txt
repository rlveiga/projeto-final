The Sandbox team is building a unique virtual world where players can build, own, and monetize
their gaming experiences using SAND, the main utility token of the platform.
SAND holders will be also able to participate in governance of the platform via a Decentralized
Autonomous Organization (DAO), where they can exercise voting rights on key decisions of The
Sandbox ecosystem. As a player, you can create digital assets (Non-Fungible Tokens, aka NFTs),
upload them to the marketplace, and drag-and-drop them to create game experiences with The
Sandbox Game Maker. The Sandbox has secured over 50 partnerships including Atari, Crypto Kitties,
and Shaun the Sheep to build a fun, creative “play-to-earn” Gaming platform, owned and made by
players. The Sandbox aims to bring blockchain into mainstream gaming, attracting both crypto and
non-crypto game enthusiasts by offering the advantages of true-ownership, digital scarcity,
monetization capabilities, and interoperability

The advent of the blockchain technology has introduced the world of decentralization and is challenging our preconceived perspectives of the current social, political, and economic systems, most notably, the central banking system. The rapid advancement of this technology has begun to blend world borders and statute, providing glimpses of an improved, alternative future. Yet, the technology is still at its infancy and is confronted with limitations in terms of performance, ease of use, and service quality. Generally, the majority of blockchain projects place emphasis on their decentralization methodology and lack evidence of adoption in the real world due to their technological and business limitations. The ICON Project (“ICON”, “ICON Network”, “we”, “our”, “us”) aims to overcome such challenges and help advance our society towards true hyperconnectivity. This paper outlines our vision and philosophy of the ICON Project and details on the supporting proprietary technologies that have been in development over the past few years. More importantly, we discuss actual use cases with dozens of reputable institutions that are already in the ICON Network. This demonstrates our progress beyond the initial concept stage and validates our team’s strong execution ability; a major factor that differentiates ICON from the majority of blockchain projects today. ICON is inspired by Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari’s rhizome – “the world with no center point and the world where any point is a mere connection to other points.” ICON is a connector of disparate cryptocurrencies with different blockchain governances, and furthermore, a connector of the crypto world to our real world. ICON embraces the new and the unfamiliar, the principle of radical inclusion – accept new ideas and decisions made by the new republic established by ever-changing crypto-to-real world connections.

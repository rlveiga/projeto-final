The authors introduce Sia, a platform for decentralized storage. Sia enables the formation of storage contracts between peers. Contracts are agreements between a storage provider and their client, defining
what data will be stored and at what price. They
require the storage provider to prove, at regular intervals, that they are still storing their clientâ€™s data.
Contracts are stored in a blockchain, making them
publicly auditable. In this respect, Sia can be viewed
as a Bitcoin derivative that includes support for such
contracts. Sia will initially be implemented as an altcoin, and later financially connected to Bitcoin via a
two-way peg.

Ocean Protocol is an on-ramp for data services into crypto ecosystems, using datatokens. Each datatoken is a fungible ERC20 token to access a given data service. Ocean smart contracts and libraries make it easy to publish data services (deploy and mint datatokens) and consume data services (spend datatokens). Ocean contracts run on Ethereum mainnet to start, with other deployments to follow. Ethereum composability enables crypto wallets as data wallets, crypto exchanges as data marketplaces, data DAOs as data co-ops, and more. Ocean Market is an open-source community marketplace for data. It supports automac determinaon of price using an “automated market maker” (AMM). Each datatoken has its own AMM pool, deployed in a gas-efficient manner. Anyone can add liquidity, aka stake (equivalent in AMMs). This is curaon, as stake is a proxy to dataset quality. Publishing amounts to an “inial data offering” (IDO). We envision thousands of data marketplaces, where Ocean Market is just one. In addion to Ocean Market being open-source (and therefore forkable), Ocean includes tools to help developers build their own marketplaces and other apps. Ocean’s “Compute-to-Data” feature gives compute access on privately held data, which never leaves the data owner’s premises. Ocean-based marketplaces enable monezaon of private data while preserving privacy. These tools are part of a system designed for long-term growth of a permissionless Web3 Data Economy. The Ocean Data Farming program incenvizes a supply of data. The community-driven OceanDAO funds soware development, outreach, and more. Its income is Ocean apps revenue, Ocean Network Rewards (51% of OCEAN supply) and Ocean Protocol Foundaon treasury. Token dynamics are designed such that OCEAN health rises with usage volume.

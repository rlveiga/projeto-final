The advent of secure public blockchains through
Bitcoin and later Ethereum, has brought forth a notable degree
of interest and capital influx, providing the premise for a
global wave of permissionless innovation. Despite lofty promises,
creating a decentralized, secure and scalable public blockchain
has proved to be a strenuous task.
This paper proposes Elrond, a novel architecture which goes
beyond state of the art by introducing a genuine state sharding
scheme for practical scalability, eliminating energy and computational waste while ensuring distributed fairness through a
Secure Proof of Stake (SPoS) consensus. Having a strong focus on
security, Elrond’s network is built to ensure resistance to known
security problems like Sybil attack, Nothing at Stake attack and
others. In an ecosystem that strives for interconnectivity, our
solution for smart contracts offers an EVM compliant engine to
ensure interoperability by design.
Preliminary simulations and testnet results reflect that Elrond
exceeds Visa’s average throughput and achieves an improvement
beyond three orders of magnitude or 1000x compared to the
existing viable approaches, while drastically reducing the costs
of bootstrapping and storage to ensure long term sustainability

The Humaniq team is building a next generation model for financial
services (Banking 4.0) which is based on Blockchain technology,
mobile devices and biometric identification systems. We will use
cryptofinancing (Initial Coin Offering) for growth capital rather than
traditional venture capital and shareholders.
Our aim is to empower a market of 2 billion people who currently don’t have access to banking across the world. Almost half the
world — over three billion people — live on less than $2.50 a day.
At least 80% of humanity lives on less than $10 a day. More than
80 percent of the world’s population lives in countries where income
differentials are widening.
We believe Humaniq can help reverse these trends and help
bring people out of poverty by giving them banking tools that can
provide liquidity for entrepreneurial ventures via loans, investment,
online work and cryptofinancing as well as create new opportunities in
the digital economy, locally, nationally and internationally. Humaniq
can also help mitigate the refugee crises occurring in many countries
in the West due to economic disparity and lack of opportunities in
emerging economies.
Our unique selling proposition (USP) in the digital banking
market is our use of Blockchain technology combined with biometrics
and a focus on mobile technology. We plan to not only provide a
software solution but also bring mobile hardware (phones) into the
markets we are aiming for in Africa, Asia and South America.

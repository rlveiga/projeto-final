Machine learning competitions are susceptible to intentional overfitting. Numerai
proposes Numeraire, a new cryptographic token that can be used in a novel auction
mechanism to make overfitting economically irrational. The auction mechanism
leads to equilibrium bidding behavior that reveals rational data scientists’ confidence in their models’ ability to perform well on new data. The auction mechanism
also yields natural arguments for the economic value of a Numeraire token.

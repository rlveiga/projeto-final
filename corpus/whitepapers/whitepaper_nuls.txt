It is an open-source project that separates its features into customizable modules such as smart contracts, the multichain system, cross-chain consensus and other operating mechanisms. In the future, NULS will have multiple sub-chains that are based on functionalities of the main-chain. They will use the underlying protocols and infrastructure of NULS to offer businesses a simplified and tailored solution based on their needs.

A network is presented that can facilitate permissionless exchange of digital assets at fair market prices, resistant to attack. The network is serviced by a group of anonymous nodes who bond a certain amount of the networkâ€™s asset and are continuously churned to ensure liveness and prevent capture. The nodes are compelled to participate in continuous key-generation ceremonies to create vaults with a virtual private key. They then monitor these vaults on external networks such as Bitcoin and Ethereum and make witness transactions into a replicated state machine when inbound transactions are observed. The state machine comes to consensus on these observations and applies exchange logic to them. Outgoing transactions are then delegated to smaller signing committees for expedited processing, which participate in multi-party computation to sign the transactions and broadcast back to the correct network. The network is most optimal when 2/3rds of the native network asset is bonded and 1/3rd is staked, at that point all assets can be underwritten. Protocol incentives aim to drive this behaviour. The network is governance-minimal, letting staked capital drive network direction

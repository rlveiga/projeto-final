Ravencoin is a blockchain and platform optimized for transferring assets, such as
tokens, from one holder to another. Based on the extensive development and testing of the
UTXO model of the Bitcoin protocol, Ravencoin is built on a fork of the Bitcoin code. Key
changes include a block reward time of one minute, a change in the number of coins issued,
but not the weighted distribution schedule and the addition of asset creation and messaging
capabilities. Ravencoin is free and open source. All Ravencoin (RVN) are fairly issued and
mined publicly and transparently using Proof of Work (POW) using the x16r algorithm
which was created for Ravencoin. There is no private, public, founder, or developer
allocation set aside. Ravencoin is intended to prioritize security, user control, privacy, and
censorship resistance. It is open to use and development in any jurisdiction, while allowing
simple additional features for users based on need.

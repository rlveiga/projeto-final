Lunyr (pronounced “lunar”) is an Ethereum­based decentralized crowdsourced
encyclopedia which rewards users with app tokens for peer­reviewing and contributing
information. We aim to be the starting point of the internet for finding reliable, accurate
information. Our long­term vision is to develop a knowledge base API that developers
can use to create next generation decentralized applications in Artificial Intelligence,
Virtual Reality, Augmented Reality, and more.

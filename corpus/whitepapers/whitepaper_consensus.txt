Consensus is the open-sourced, decentralized artificial intelligence platform, powered by native cryptocurrency and built with the vision to improve the governance mechanisms at all levels of organizational structures: community, startup, NGO, enterprise, city, county or the entire country. Once fully realized, Consensus AI will be able to offer automated, data-driven solutions to the most complex problems of our collective co-existence by modelling the potential outcomes of proposed changes. At its basis, it will contain a set of principles, which will guide its development and evolution. This paper discusses the approach, methodology, the network model, its governance and and the underlying design principles, technology requirements, product roadmap and adoption strategy.

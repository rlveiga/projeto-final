This paper proposes a new blockchain architecture based on Proof
of History (PoH) - a proof for verifying order and passage of time
between events. PoH is used to encode trustless passage of time into
a ledger - an append only data structure. When used alongside a
consensus algorithm such as Proof of Work (PoW) or Proof of Stake
(PoS), PoH can reduce messaging overhead in a Byzantine Fault Tolerant replicated state machine, resulting inn sub-second finality times.
This paper also proposes two algorithms that leverage the time keeping properties of the PoH ledger - a PoS algorithm that can recover
from partitions of any size and an efficient streaming Proof of Replication (PoRep). The combination of PoRep and PoH provides a defense
against forgery of the ledger with respect to time (ordering) and storage. The protocol is analyzed on a 1 gbps network, and this paper
shows that throughput up to 710k transactions per second is possible
with todays hardware.

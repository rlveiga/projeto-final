In this white paper, we present the Ankr Blockchain, a multi-chain
and useful work based decentralized network with a native data
feed. We first review a novel mining solution using the Proof of
Useful Work (PoUW) consensus. We will explain the Multiple-Chain
Structure and then describe how we plan to provide an generic
interface for Town Crier, an authenticated data feed for smart contracts. We will also discuss how Ankrâ€™s technologies will enable decentralized cloud computing. Finally, we will characterize the Ankr
Ecosystem and the app interface to further facilitate the utilization
of the Ankr network.

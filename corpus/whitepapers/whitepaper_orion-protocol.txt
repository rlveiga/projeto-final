Orion is a new kind of DeFi platform that combines the best features of exchanges,
brokerages, and instant trading apps. The platform is built around a liquidity aggregator
connected to all of the major crypto exchanges and swap pools (centralized and
decentralized), enabling users to gain the best price for their trades from a single portal.
Along with powerful tools for portfolio management, Orion offers exceptional security,
convenience, and flexibility. The platform is suitable for experienced traders, institutional
traders, and newcomers alike. The Orion platform and ecosystem is powered by the ORN token, an ERC-20 token. Orion
Protocol will be an open source repository for dApps, making all of the platformâ€™s
functionality available to developers and businesses, enabling anyone to build powerful
financial tools.

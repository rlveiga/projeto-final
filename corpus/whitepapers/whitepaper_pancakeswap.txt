PancakeSwap is a type of DEX known as an automated market maker (AMM). This essentially means that there are no order books, bid/ask system or limit/market orders. 
Instead, users trading on the platform automatically draw liquidity from one or more liquidity pools, which then rebalance after the trade is complete. Trades conducted on an AMM, like PancakeSwap, subtract liquidity from one side of the pool and add liquidity to the other, thereby changing the weights of the assets in that pool and their relative values. 
This liquidity is contributed by users, known as liquidity providers (LPs), who add equal values of both sides of a liquidity pool (e.g. BNB/USDC) to increase the total amount of liquidity available. Users receive LP tokens that represent their share in that particular pool. These tokens need to be returned in order to retrieve their fraction of the pool. In return for providing liquidity, LPs receive a share of the transaction fees generated by any pools they contribute. There is a flat 0.25% transaction fee for makers and takers, most of which is shared among the liquidity providers.
As a decentralized application (DApp), PancakeSwap is generally accessed through a supported Web3 wallet, such as MetaMask, TrustWallet, or WalletConnect. Once configured to support Binance Smart Chain, these wallets are used to interact with the PancakeSwap smart contracts via the intuitive PancakeSwap front-end.

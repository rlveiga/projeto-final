Throughout history we have witnessed many changes in our culture,
technology, and governance. These changes are fueled by a necessity for
the further evolution of mankind. Now humanity approaches another
one of these times in history, where the way everything has been done
must be changed; this is why we built Nexus. Peer-to-Peer technology
fuels the backbone of a global blockchain-based cryptocurrency represented by the ticker: NXS which is traded world-wide as an alternative
currency with the capacity to rival world economies. The framework,
Nexus, utilizes new distributed database designs, mathematical trust,
community governance, ground-based mesh networks, and a Low Earth
Orbit Satellite Constellation. We are Nexus, a connection of people,
ideas, and computers providing greater choice and therefore greater
evolution with an aim towards our freedom.

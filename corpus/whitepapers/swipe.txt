The world is going mobile and it is changing the way we live.
The average consumer checks their mobile phone more than 150 times a
day. Global mobile application (“app”) revenue grew to $88 billion in
2017 [1]. While the opportunities in the mobile space are obvious,
mobile app developers continue to face challenges in effectively
understanding their users and monetising the apps.
This paper presents “SWIPE Network” — a decentralised mobile
engagement data platform that will empower app developers with a suite
of marketing tools (via SDK - software development kit) to monetise
anonymised data transparently and fairly using blockchain technology.
App users will be rewarded for contributing their data while
maintaining full control of privacy and data sharing. App developers
can increase their app active usage and retention through the SDK.
They can get more data from the SWIPE Network, and improve the apps
based on the data obtained.
The proposed solution will be built on top of our existing
product – SwipeRich[2] mobile lockscreen content delivery solution
which has been successfully deployed to more than half a million users
in Indonesia and Philippines.

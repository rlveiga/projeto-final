We design and build KyberNetwork, an on-chain protocol which allows instant                       exchange and conversion of digital assets (e.g. crypto tokens) and cryptocurrencies (e.g. Ether,                         Bitcoin, ZCash) with high liquidity. KyberNetwork will be the first system that implements several                           ideal operating properties of an exchange including trustless, decentralized execution, instant                     trade and high liquidity. Besides serving as an exchange, KyberNetwork also provides payment                         APIs that will allow Ethereum accounts to easily receive payments from any crypto tokens. As                             an example, any merchant can now use KyberNetwork APIs to allow users to pay in any crypto                                 tokens, but the merchant will receive payments in Ether (ETH) or other preferred tokens. Although running on the Ethereum network, KyberNetwork’s roadmap includes supporting                   cross-chain trades between different cryptocurrencies using relays and future protocols like                     Polkadot and Cosmos. Ethereum accounts will be able to safely receive payment from Bitcoin,                           ZCash and other cryptocurrencies via our payment APIs, through this trustless payment service.                         Derivatives will be introduced to mitigate the exposure to the risk of volatilities for the users of                                 KyberNetwork Crystals (KNC) and selected cryptocurrencies. This will allow users to participate                       in the price movements synthetically.

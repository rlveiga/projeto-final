Aave is a decentralised non-custodial liquidity protocol where users can participate as depositors or borrowers. Depositors provide liquidity to the market to earn a passive income, while borrowers are able to borrow in an over-collateralised (perpetually) or under-collateralised (one-block liquidity) fashion.  The following documentation describes the fundamentals of the protocol and how to interact with it. Please join the #development room in the Aave community Discord server; our team and members of the community look forward to helping you build on top of Aave.

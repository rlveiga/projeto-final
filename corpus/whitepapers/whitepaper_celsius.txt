Celsius Network is developing a new foundation to drive the emerging crypto-assets based economy. Members will gain access to fiat-currency loans using their crypto coins as collateral. Later on, Celsius will also provide a new way for crypto-assets holders (Lenders) to leverage their holdings and get rewarded simply by transferring their assets under management to the Celsius platform wallet from their current wallet or cold storage device. Celsius will generate income for coin holders by allowing hedge funds and crypto funds, to create short positions on cryptocurrencies using actual coins borrowed from the Celsius pool of lenders. The top 20 crypto-assets will be accessed and charged fees for the shorting or purchased for leveraged margin trades. The system protocols will be optimized to provide the most value for both lenders and borrowers by utilizing advanced algorithms to maximize matching of bid and ask contracts and optimizing profitability for the lender community. Celsius will use a modified Black-Scholes algorithm to generate the amount of deposit required from borrowers for each coin. The interest paid for each coin will be produced algorithmically, but borrowers may compete for a better chance to loan coins by bidding in a reverse auction market. Celsius plans to open a new liquid market with easy to use agile trading tools for crypto borrowers which will have a much lower costs than the proposed futures and options markets planned by the CME, CBOE and NASDAQ. Celsius will provide a large and robust crypto-assets pool from lenders allowing borrowers to leverage margin trades. Celsius aims to offer various incentives for lenders to keep their assets in the pool. For example, cash surplus will be used to enable dollar margin loans to lenders against their crypto assets which helps offset the short only positions opened by borrowers and lock in coins from leaving the platform.

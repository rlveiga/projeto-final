The AdEx team is building the next generation online ad exchange that is based on
blockchain technology. Our goal is to provide a more efficient, intuitive and transparent
advertising platform.
Our aim is to disrupt the existing online advertising landscape and address the significant
problems it faces such as advertising fraud, privacy and consent to receiving sponsored
messages, and the rise of ad blockers. With digital surpassing all other advertising mediums
and accounting for close to 40% of global marketing and ad spend in 2017, we see the need
of innovation in this area.
We believe we can empower advertisers and publishers with a platform that is secure,
transparent and beneficial for all the parties involved in the process including consumers
who have been left out by existing advertising networks.
Our expertise in the fields of software development, blockchain & cryptography, video
streaming and online advertising give us the confidence in creating an ad exchange that will
be superior to all existing solutions used around the world.

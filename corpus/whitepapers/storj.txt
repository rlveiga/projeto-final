Decentralized cloud storage represents a fundamental shift in the eciency and economics of large-scale storage. Eliminating central control allows users to store and share
data without reliance on a third-party storage provider. Decentralization mitigates the
risk of data failures and outages while simultaneously increasing the security and privacy
of object storage. It also allows market forces to optimize for less expensive storage at a
greater rate than any single provider could aord. Although there are many ways to build
such a system, there are some specific responsibilities any given implementation should
address. Based on our experience with petabyte-scale storage systems, we introduce a
modular framework for considering these responsibilities and for building our distributed
storage network. Additionally, we describe an initial concrete implementation for the
entire framework.

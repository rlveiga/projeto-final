This technical whitepaper explains some of the design decisions behind the Uniswap v2 core contracts. It covers the contracts’ new features—including arbitrary pairs between ERC20s, a hardened price oracle that allows other contracts to estimate the time-weighted average price over a given interval, “flash swaps” that allow traders to receive assets and use them elsewhere before paying for them later in the transaction, and a protocol fee that can be turned on in the future. It also re-architects the contracts to reduce their attack surface. This whitepaper describes the mechanics of Uniswap v2’s “core” contracts including the pair contract that stores liquidity providers’ funds—and the factory contract used to instantiate pair contracts.

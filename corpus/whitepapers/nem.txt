NEM, in its most basic form, is a crypto currency that is built on block chain
technology. The NEM block chain is an improvement on existing block
chain technologies. It integrates concepts from other cryptocurrencies (e.g.
Bitcoin) and academic research in network theory.
NEM’s primary contribution to the crypto currency landscape is a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Importance (PoI). Unlike Proof of Work (PoW), it is environmentally sustainable and does not require large scale computing resources in perpetuity. PoI
is similar to Proof of Stake (PoS) except that it is not solely derived from the size of an
account’s balance. It incorporates other behaviors that are believed to be positive for the
holistic economy. In this way, it attempts to reward active economy participants at the
expense of inactive ones and dampens the rich getting richer effect that is inherent to
PoS.
NEM’s vision is to be the foundation of a vibrant crypto currency ecosystem that
emphasizes security and trustless computing. NEM was launched with built-in support
for multisig transactions and encrypted messages. Additionally, the peer-to-peer (P2P)
NEM network implements a modified version of Eigentrust++ to identify and minimize
the impact of malicious nodes.
NEM is evolving and this is just the beginning. Stay tuned for more things to come.

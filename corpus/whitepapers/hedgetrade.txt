Capital markets, in general, are riddled with fear, uncertainty, and doubt. As a result,
volatility cannot be explained through conventional principles and financial predictions
available on the internet generally become baseless and hard to trust. The lack of a
democratic process when determining reliable information with the sheer volume of
participants leaves many with information that is challenging to rely on. HedgeTrade is a
networking hub for financial and cryptocurrency trading experts, and for newcomers
seeking trading predictions for cryptocurrencies, stocks, options, commodities, or any other
tradable product. The HedgeTrade platform is driven by the HEDG token, this improves
investor confidence for these predictions through staking mechanisms operated via smart
contracts, and through a proprietary user rank algorithm that highlights users with excellent
performance.

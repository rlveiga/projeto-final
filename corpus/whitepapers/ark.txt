ARK empowers everyone, regardless of their aim or
technical background, to quickly and easily leverage blockchain
technology. Our whitepaper will identify well known problems within
the blockchain industry and illustrate how ARK technology solves
them. In the current hype-driven blockchain landscape, ARK acts as
a beacon for individuals, groups, and enterprises seeking to apply
blockchain technology to both reach their individual goals and affect
change in their local community. ARKâ€™s uniquely simple technology
stack allows almost anyone to create and deploy standalone
blockchains for any use case. These newly created blockchains will
have the ability to interoperate through ARK SmartBridge
Technology. ARK is also reinventing smart contracts with ARK Logic,

and plugins. ARK Logic brings security, adaptability, and scalability to
decentralized computing workflows. Most importantly, the ARK

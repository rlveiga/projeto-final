Status is an open source messaging platform and mobile interface to interact with
decentralized applications that run on the Ethereum Network.
This document presents a utility network token for Status, the first ever mobile Ethereum
client built entirely on peer-to-peer technologies.
The messenger form-factor is chosen to make Ethereum feel as familiar as possible to the
average smartphone user, while providing a flexible platform for DApp developers, aimed to
maximise the amount of daily use of Ethereum’s public blockchain.
The Status Network token is a modular utility token that fuels the Status network. This
includes a Decentralized Push Notification Market, Governance of the Status client,
Community Curation of content, along with social communication tools such as Tribute to
Talk. We also propose a fiat-to-crypto 'Teller Network', DApp Directory, Sticker Market, and
demonstrate our research on a User Acquisition Engine to grow the Network.
The Status Network Token (‘SNT’) will be distributed at a rate of 10,000 SNT per 1 ETH to
participants in the Contribution Period, and is expected to begin on June 20th. The
Contribution Period will run for 14 days, or within 24 hours of the first ceiling of 12M CHF
(Swiss Francs) having been reached (outlined on Page 2).

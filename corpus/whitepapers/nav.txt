Cryptocurrency technology is decentralised by design. It is believed that rigorous
truth is a natural byproduct of an open source platform run by the public. The
decentralisation and automation of systems enable people to make informed
choices about the systems in which they choose to participate and provides an
even playing field as never seen before in history.
As well as the inherently democratic nature of decentralised systems, they offer
protection to the participants by providing a safety in numbers hypothesis. This
limits the ability of malicious actors to threaten or attack participants in the system
due to the number of people involved and the global nature of their relationships.
Another advantage is that they are extremely robust. Once a piece of software
has entered the public domain, it becomes impractical and virtually impossible to
shut down completely. This enables security to the future of the system and
knowledge that if the public deems it valuable it will persist.

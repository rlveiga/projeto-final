Typical blockchains have several major well-known problems with data storage. Theseproblems require new third-party protocols tobe integrated on-top of existing blockchains,as fees are too high for on-chain storage to befeasible. Therefore, with typical blockchainsthere is always going to be a cost to accesscontent, and content is never stored perma-nently. As the demand for data storage growsexponentially, the need for a decentralizedlow-cost data storage protocol that can scaleis a necessity.In this work we present Arweave – a newblockchain like structure called the block-weave. The blockweave is a platform de-signed to provide scalable on-chain storage ina cost-eﬃcient manner for the very ﬁrst time.As the amount of data stored in the systemincreases, the amount of hashing needed forconsensus decreases, thus reducing the cost of storing data. The protocol’s existing RESTAPI makes it trivially simple to build de-centralised applications on top of the block-weave, reﬂecting Arweave’s focus on the de-veloper community and their ability to driveadoption of emerging and novel protocols.In this paper, we also introduce novel con-cepts such as; block-shadowing, a ﬂexibly-sized transaction block distribution algo-rithm that improves on current ‘sharding’techniques by other blockchains, a self-optimising network topology, and a new con-sensus mechanism called proof of access.

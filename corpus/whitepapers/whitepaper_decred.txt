Distributed, token-incentivized timestamping systems ledgers such as Bitcoin have become a mainstay of modern finance. We have implemented a platform combining elements of proof-of-work (PoW) and proof-of-stake (PoS) blockchains in an attempt to garner the benefits of both systems. Less major change to our consensus network include additional elliptic curve signature suites, refinement and modification of the existing scripting language, added extensibility in multiple areas to support future changes to the protocol, and distributed stake pooling.

 We present a scalable, agent-centric distributed computing platform. We use a
formalism to characterize distributed systems, show how it applies to some existing distributed
systems, and demonstrate the benefits of shifting from a data-centric to an agent-centric model.
We present a detailed formal specification of the Holochain system, along with an analysis of its
systemic integrity, capacity for evolution, total system computational complexity, implications for
use-cases, and current implementation status.

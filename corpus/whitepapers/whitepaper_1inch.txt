This paper, presents Mooniswap – an AMM that uses the constant-product invariant, with the extension of virtual balances. Unlike otherAMM designs, Mooniswap’s virtual balances allows to blunt the priceimpact of the short-term trading volume slippage. This allows proﬁts thatwould otherwise be captured by arbitrageurs to instead be captured byliquidity providers. This makes Mooniswap signiﬁcantly more proﬁtablefor liquidity providers than most other AMM designs.

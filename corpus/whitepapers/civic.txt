This paper is an extension of the original Civic
whitepaper and expands on the design of the
token economy of the digital identity ecosystem.
This expansion aims to incentivize appropriate
types of behavior within the
network that optimize efficiency
and accuracy in identity
verification services, without
using oracles which violate user
privacy. The paper provides an
overview of the digital identity
ecosystem and subsequently
characterizes the network in
terms of actors, behaviors
and network attack vectors
(as defined below). A model
predicated on game theory is
then introduced to incentivize
appropriate behaviors while
minimizing the risks of any
attack vectors. The model uses
a staking mechanism to ensure
compliance and, given certain
assumptions on the rationality
of actors involved, should assure
the good behavior of actors.

Civic is building an ecosystem that
is designed to facilitate on-demand,
secure and low-cost access to identity
verification services via the blockchain,
such that background and personal
information verification checks will no
longer need to be undertaken from the
ground up every time. The Civic token,
or CVC, is intended to allow participants
in the ecosystem to transact in ID
verification-related services, while
ensuring network integrity with game
theory applications. Civic envisions that
this ecosystem will reduce the overall
costs of identity verification, remove
inefficiencies, enhance security and
privacy, greatly improve user experience
and disrupt the current identity
verification supply chain.

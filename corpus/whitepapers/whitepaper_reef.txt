In the current Decentralized Finance (DeFi) landscape, trading, lending, borrowing, staking, and mining crypto assets are fragmented and create a painful experience for all of its participants. There is a glaring need for service that will aggregate liquidity, facilitate and automate crypto asset trading with more security and efficiency, and provide better data and insights into risk and portfolio management. While centralized exchanges (CEX) are isolated and prone to breaches, decentralized exchanges (DEX) have little liquidity and are difficult to use. Neither of them integrates with the DeFi ecosystem directly, forcing daily traders to struggle and manually stitch up the most profitable transaction pathways, while pushing large investors towards OTC desks where they are dealt suboptimal yields. Reef is a DeFi operating system, smart liquidity aggregator, and yield engine that resolves these issues by connecting crypto asset buyers and sellers to liquidity pools in exchanges and the DeFi ecosystem, and streamlines crypto asset management though an AI-driven trading engine that maximizes yield within each risk category. Reef delivers on the promise of smarter crypto trading through two major components and enables: • Trading of assets via the Global Liquidity Aggregator with access to liquidity from both centralized exchanges and DEX’s; • Smart lending, borrowing, staking, mining through the AI-driven personalized Reef Smart Yield Farming Aggregator. Reef does not require the user to give away their private keys, and operates under Polkadot’s shared security model, ensuring high resilience and forkless upgradability. Reef is a non-custodial, decentralized network governed entirely by Reef token holders via a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) to achieve a transparent future: a future based on more truth and less trust.

In this article we write about our mission statement and describe what sets us apart from the existing solutions in DeFi’s asset management segment.
When it comes to managing assets, the main worry (other than the performance) is usually reliability, in other words, the trustability of who is managing your money.
Specifically in DeFi, hodling or simply trading your favorite assets requires multiple transactions and prohibitive gas fees, compounded to the n times as many assets you’re looking to invest in.
DEXTF is an asset management protocol that empowers anyone to mint, trade, redeem and provide liquidity on non-custodial oracle-less tokenized portfolios (XTFs).
XTF token funds are mintable and redeemable for the underlying assets (click here for the full list) and they are unique for each fund created.
DEXTF is built for DeFi to exchange value at a higher velocity without ever losing track of ownership.
Earn rewards and fees by providing liquidity XTF fund tokens.
With the introduction of the new tokenomics, you can earn by just holding a tokenized holding.

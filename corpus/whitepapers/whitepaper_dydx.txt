dYdX allows creation of entirely new asset classes which derive their value from underlying
blockchain-based assets. Financial products such as derivatives and margin trades allow investors to
achieve superior risk management with their portfolios, and open up new avenues for speculation. They
also increase market efficiency for the underlying asset by aiding in price discovery and allowing
individuals to express more complex opinions on price and volatility. dYdX provides advantages over
traditional financial products by eliminating the need for a regulated central clearing house, providing
global and equal access, and allowing users full control of their funds at all times. dYdX will offer a number of decentralized protocols implementing various types of crypto-asset financial
products. These protocols are comprised of open source Ethereum Smart Contracts and standards.

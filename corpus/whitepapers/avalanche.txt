This paper introduces a family of leaderless Byzantine fault tolerance protocols, built around a metastable mechanism via network subsampling. These protocols provide a strong
probabilistic safety guarantee in the presence of Byzantine adversaries while their concurrent and leaderless nature enables them
to achieve high throughput and scalability. Unlike blockchains
that rely on proof-of-work, they are quiescent and green. Unlike
traditional consensus protocols where one or more nodes typically
process linear bits in the number of total nodes per decision, no
node processes more than logarithmic bits. It does not require
accurate knowledge of all participants and exposes new possible
tradeoffs and improvements in safety and liveness for building
consensus protocols.
The paper describes the Snow protocol family, analyzes its
guarantees, and describes how it can be used to construct the core
of an internet-scale electronic payment system called Avalanche,
which is evaluated in a large scale deployment. Experiments
demonstrate that the system can achieve high throughput (3400
tps), provide low confirmation latency (1.35 sec), and scale well
compared to existing systems that deliver similar functionality.
For our implementation and setup, the bottleneck of the system
is in transaction verification.

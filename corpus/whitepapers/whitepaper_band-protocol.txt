Decentralized applications have huge potential to disrupt traditional busi-nesses by replacing centralized middleman with automatically-executed, trust-less smart contracts. In Web 2.0, centralized corporates act as gatekeepers whostore and distribute data in a way that is most proﬁtable to them [19]. Web 3.0,the decentralized web, has promised a paradigm shift to restore data ownershipand ret u rn the internet to the hands of users.However, decentralized applications still need to re ly on data to operateand function in a trustless way. Smart contracts currently have no easy wayto access reliable real-world information making its use case rather limited. Atpresence, curr ent decentralized applications rely on centralized data providers,representing a single point of failure and defeating the purpose of being decen-tralized in the ﬁrs t place.Band is an open protocol that facilitat es t h e governance of data used indecentralized blockchain syste ms . The protocol functions as an open standardfor data handling and data management. This whitepaper outlines how BandProtocol intends to solve data ac ce ssi b i li ty and data r e li ab i li ty in a full y de-centralized m ann er . Th i s includes how Band provides data endpoint such thatany smart contracts can easily cons um e real-world data and data governancemechanism to ensure data integrity.While Band is initially built on top of Ethereum [18], the protocol itselfis blockchain-agnostic and will eventually b e supported on all major smartcontract platforms including Cosmos Network and EOS [13, 1]. Band’s visionis to become the go-to decentralized world’s dat abas e which any decentralizedprograms or applications can rely on for trusted data.
